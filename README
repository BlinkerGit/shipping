== Welcome to Shipping

Shipping is a module that connects APIs for various shippers like UPS and FedEx.

== Download

* gem install shipping
* http://rubyforge.org/projects/shipping
* svn co http://rufy.com/svn/shipping/trunk

=== Usage

There is going to be some data that will persist for all
connections. For example, you will not want to repeat the fedex
account number every time in your implementation code. To set default
values, set up a file called .shipping.yml in the home directory of
the user who will be using this library.  An example file would be:

    fedex_url: https://gatewaybeta.fedex.com/GatewayDC
    fedex_account: 1234556
    fedex_meter: 387878
    
    ups_account: 7B4F74E3075AEEFF
    ups_user: username
    ups_password: password

You can set as many default values as you would like in this file.
Its name, location, and values are overridable on a per-connection
basis.

When it comes to actually getting a shipping quote, do something like this:

    require 'shipping'
    
    ups = Shipping::UPS.new :zip => 97202, :sender_zip => 10001, :weight => 2
    ups.price => 8.77
    ups.valid_address? => false
    
    ups.city = "Portland"
    ups.valid_address? => true
    
Alternately, you can instantiate the base class and then see both UPS and FedEx information:

    ship = Shipping::Base.new :zip => 97202, :state => "OR", :sender_zip => 10001, :weight => 2
    ship.ups.price => 8.77
    ship.fedex.price => 5.17
    
    ship.city = "Portland"
    ship.ups.valid_address? => true
